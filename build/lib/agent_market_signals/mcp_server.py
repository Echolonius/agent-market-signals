"""Optional MCP (Model Context Protocol) server: exposes the detectors as tools
an AI agent can call at decision time.

Install the optional dependency and run it:

    pip install "agent-market-signals[mcp] @ git+https://github.com/Echolonius/agent-market-signals"
    agent-market-signals-mcp

The server runs locally over stdio. It hosts nothing and sends nothing anywhere;
it is a connector between an MCP-capable client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and
others) and this library.

The tool functions below are plain and dependency-free, so they can be tested
without the ``mcp`` package. Only :func:`build_server` imports it.
