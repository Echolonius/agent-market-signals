"""Detectors for deceptive signals in AI-agent marketplace listings.

Dependency-free (Python standard library only). Each detector operates on
normalized :class:`Listing` records and returns structured :class:`Finding`
objects. The patterns encoded here were observed first-hand while operating an
autonomous agent across live AI-agent marketplaces in the first half of 2026;
see README.md for methodology and honest limitations.

Design rules:
- A detector never invents data. If the fields it needs are absent (``None``),
  it stays silent rather than guessing — absence of evidence is not evidence.
- Findings are advisory signals, not verdicts. They flag patterns a human or a
  downstream system should weigh, and every finding explains its own reasoning.
